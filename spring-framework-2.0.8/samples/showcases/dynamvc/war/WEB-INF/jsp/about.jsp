     <h1>Overview of this sample application</h1>
     <p class="paragraph">
This small application showcases implementing Spring MVC Controllers
using the dynamic language support introduced in Spring 2.0.</p>


<p class="paragraph">The web application is *very* simplistic, because the intent is
to convey the basics of the dynamic language support as applied to
Spring MVC and pretty much nothing else.</p>

<p class="paragraph">There is one Groovy file in the application. It is called
<code>FortuneController.groovy</code> and it is located in the <code>war/WEB-INF/groovy</code>
folder. This Groovy script file is referenced by the 'fortune'
bean in the <code>war/WEB-INF/fortune-servlet.xml</code> Spring MVC configuration file.</p>

<p class="paragraph">You will notice that the <code>fortune</code> bean is set as refreshable via the use
of the <code>refresh-check-delay</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;lang:groovy/&gt;</code> element. The
value of this attribute is set to <code>3000</code> which means that changes to the
<code>FortuneController.groovy</code> file will be picked up after a delay of 3 seconds.</p>

<p class="paragraph">If you deploy the application to Tomcat (for example), you can then go into
the exploded <code>/WEB-INF/groovy</code> folder and edit the <code>FortuneController.groovy</code>
file directly. Any such changes that you make will be automatically picked up
and the <code>fortune</code> bean will be reconfigured... all without having to stop,
redeply and restart the application. Try it yourself... now admittedly
there is not a lot of complex logic in the <code>FortuneController.groovy</code> file
(which is good because <code>Controllers</code> in Spring MVC should be as thin as possible).</p>

<p class="paragraph">You could try returning a default Fortune instead of delegating to the injected
<code>FortuneService</code>, or you could return a different logical view name, or
(if you are feeling more ambitious) you could try creating a custom
Groovy implementation of the <code>FortuneService</code> interface and try plugging that into
the web application.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Perhaps your custom Groovy <code>FortuneService</code> could access
a web service to get some <code>Fortunes</code>, or apply some different randomizing logic
to the returned <code>Fortune</code>, or whatever. The key point is that you will be able to make
these changes without having to redeploy (or bounce) your application. This is
a great boon with regard to rapid prototyping.</p> </div>
