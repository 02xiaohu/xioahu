Bundle-Description: This bundle provides SLF4j implementation and config
 uration required to run m2e embedded Maven runtime  in external JVM. Th
 is bundle is NOT a general purpose slf4j-simple OSGi bundle, it does NO
 T export  any packages and it CANNOT be used as an OSGI SLF4J implement
 ation.  This is suboptimal and a better solution would be to either inc
 lude slf4j-simple as a resource in  org.eclipse.m2e.maven.runtime or us
 e SLF4J implementation of the running m2e instance. I could not  find a
 n easy way to implement either of the better solutions, so this one wil
 l have to do for now.   This bundle is referenced as Require-Bundle by 
 org.eclipse.m2e.maven.runtime to force installation  of this bundle whe
 never m2e embedded maven runtime is installed. Because no packages are 
 exported,  this does not pollute OSGi classpath. Provide-Capability/Req
 uire-Capability would be cleaner, but  I don't know if these are suppor
 ted bu P2.
